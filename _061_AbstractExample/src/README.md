Abstract Classes
- 
- Cannot be instantiated

Abstract Methods
-
- Have no method body
- Need to be inside abstract classes or interfaces

Avoids code duplication and increases reusability

The purpose of an abstract class is to function as a 
base for subclasses

Encapsulate some common functionality in one place and let 
subclasses implement differences
