Encapsulation
- The process of binding an object state and behavior together into one unit
- Wrapping data and code acting on that data together
- We can make class attributes hidden from another classes using encapsulation
- Prevent classes from being tightly coupled
- Easily modify inner workings of a class without affecting the rest of the program or consumers
- Robust to changes
- Full Control

ENCAPSULATION IS NOT HIDING DATA.IT'S BUNDLING METHODS AND DATA'S IN ONE.

WE CAN HIDE THE DATA WITH ENCAPSULATION!
