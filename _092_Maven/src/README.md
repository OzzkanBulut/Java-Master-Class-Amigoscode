**What is Jar?**
- Jar stands for Java ARchive.It's a file format based on the popular ZIP file format and is used for aggregating many files into one.


- Although JAR can be used as a general archiving tool, it's main purpose is for downloading Java applets and necessary components in a single HTTP transaction, rather than opening a new connection for each piece.
