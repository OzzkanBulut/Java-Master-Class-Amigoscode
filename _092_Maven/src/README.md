**What is Jar?**
- Jar stands for Java ARchive.It's a file format based on the popular ZIP file format and is used for aggregating many files into one.


- Although JAR can be used as a general archiving tool, it's main purpose is for downloading Java applets and necessary components in a single HTTP transaction, rather than opening a new connection for each piece.

**JAR is:**
- 
- The only archive format that is cross-platform
- The only format that handles audio and image files as well as class files
- backward-compatible with existing applet code
- an open standard, fully extendable and written in java
- the preferred way to bundle the pieces of a java applet
