SOLID PRINCIPLES
-

**Single Responsibility**<br>
Each class should have only one sole purpose, and not be filled with excessive funcionality.

**Open Closed**<br>
Classes should be open for extension, closed for modification.

In other words, you should not have to rewrite an existing class for implementing new features.

**Liskov Substitution**<br>
This means that every subclass or derived class should be substitutable for their base or parent class.

**Interface Segragation**<br>
Interfaces should not force classes to implement what they can't do.<br>
Large interfaces should be divided into small ones

**Dependancy Inversion**<br>
Components should depend on abstractions, not on concretions.
