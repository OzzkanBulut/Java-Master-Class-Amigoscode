POJO --> Plain Old Java Objects\

 This name is used to emphasize that a given object it's an \
ordinary java object that has no assosiaction with any framework.

For example, the person class in the previous module is a POJO.\

Because it has no association with no object, it does not extend any class \
nor it implements any class.Also there is no annotation.

What a POJO focuses is on the business logic.

It has no dependancies on frameworks and what it really means is that\
it has information on the business logic.
